### 👋 Hello world!

I am Gleta Kijogi, a storyteller, YouTuber, and aspiring backend web developer currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I am also enrolled in a bootcamp where I’m developing both my technical and soft skills, gaining hands-on experience in backend development.
What makes me unique is my ability to merge two worlds that often seem far apart; creativity and technology. Whether through engaging YouTube content or coding scalable systems, I bring together imagination, logic, and problem solving to create meaningful work.
My passions lie in storytelling, culture, and technology. Through storytelling, I connect with people, spark dialogue, and explore human experiences in ways that are both entertaining and thought provoking. Through technology, I channel that same creativity into building impactful digital platforms that support expression, preserve culture, and inspire communities.
Backend web development enables me to live out this passion by giving me the tools to design reliable, innovative systems that power creative platforms. In this way, I can bridge my love for art and science, using both to inspire, educate, and create change.
